# Future in the Past

## Що це таке?

**Future in the Past (Майбутній час у минулому)** — використовується для опису:
- Дій, які були майбутніми з точки зору минулого
- Планів і намірів, які були в минулому
- Прогнозів, зроблених у минулому

**Головне правило:** Ми знаходимося **в минулому** і дивимося на щось, що було **майбутнім** з тієї точки зору. Це як "переміщення" Future в минулий контекст.

## Коли використовувати?

### 1. Непряма мова (Reported Speech)

**Використовуй, коли:** передаєш слова, сказані в минулому

**Пряма мова → Непряма мова:**
- *"I **will** help you."* → He said he **would** help me.
- *"She **will** come."* → I thought she **would** come.
- *"I**'m going to** buy a car."* → He said he **was going to** buy a car.

**Приклади:**

> *He promised he **would** call.* (Він обіцяв, що передзвонить.)
> *She said she **would be** late.* (Вона сказала, що запізниться.)
> *I told him I **would help**.* (Я сказав йому, що допоможу.)

### 2. Плани й наміри в минулому

**Використовуй, коли:** розповідаєш про плани, які були раніше

> *I **was going to** call you, but I forgot.* (Я збирався подзвонити тобі, але забув.)
> *We **were going to** go to the cinema, but it was closed.* (Ми збиралися піти в кіно, але воно було зачинене.)
> *She **was going to** study medicine.* (Вона збиралася вивчати медицину.)

💡 **"Was/were going to"** часто вказує, що план **НЕ реалізувався**.

### 3. Прогнози в минулому

**Використовуй, коли:** робив прогноз у минулому

> *I knew it **would** happen.* (Я знав, що це станеться.)
> *She thought it **would** be easy.* (Вона думала, що це буде легко.)
> *I was sure he **would** pass the exam.* (Я був впевнений, що він здасть іспит.)

### 4. Описи в розповідях (storytelling)

**Використовуй, коли:** розповідаєш історію і згадуєш майбутнє з точки зору того моменту

> *Little did I know that this decision **would** change my life.* (Я й не здогадувався, що це рішення змінить моє життя.)
> *It was the last time I **would** see him.* (Це був останній раз, коли я бачив його.)
> *In a few hours, everything **would** be different.* (Через кілька годин все буде інакше.)

## Маркери часу

При Future in the Past змінюються маркери часу з прямої мови:

| Пряма мова | Непряма мова (Future in the Past) |
|------------|-----------------------------------|
| tomorrow | the next day / the following day |
| next week | the next week / the following week |
| tonight | that night |
| in two days | two days later |

**Приклади:**

> **Пряма:** *"I'll call you **tomorrow**."*
> **Непряма:** *He said he would call me **the next day**.*

> **Пряма:** *"We're going to travel **next month**."*
> **Непряма:** *They said they were going to travel **the following month**.*

## Would vs Was/Were going to

| Would | Was/Were going to |
|-------|-------------------|
| Непряма мова з "will" | Непряма мова з "going to" |
| Прогнози, обіцянки в минулому | Плани й наміри в минулому |
| Нейтральне | Часто вказує на нереалізований план |

**Порівняй:**

> *He said he **would** help.* (обіцянка в непрямій мові)
> *He **was going to** help, but he got sick.* (план, що не реалізувався)

> *I knew it **would** rain.* (прогноз)
