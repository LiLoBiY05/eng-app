# Passive Voice (Пасивний стан)

## Що це таке?

**Пасивний стан (Passive Voice)** — це граматична конструкція, коли підмет речення не виконує дію, а зазнає її. Фокус переноситься з того, хто виконує дію, на саму дію або об'єкт, який її зазнає.

**Порівняння:**
- **Active Voice (Активний стан):** Someone stole my car. *(Хтось вкрав мою машину)*
- **Passive Voice (Пасивний стан):** My car was stolen. *(Мою машину вкрали)*

## Формула пасивного стану

### Базова структура

```
Object (from active) + BE (в потрібному часі) + Past Participle (V3) + (by Agent)
```

**Приклад перетворення:**
- **Active:** The company hired John.
- **Passive:** John was hired by the company.

### Коли використовувати BY

**BY + Agent** вказує, хто або що виконало дію:
- The book was written **by Shakespeare**.
- The window was broken **by the storm**.

**BY часто опускається**, коли:
- Виконавець невідомий: *My wallet was stolen. (Невідомо ким)*
- Виконавець очевидний: *He was arrested. (Очевидно, що поліцією)*
- Виконавець неважливий: *The road was repaired. (Не важливо ким)*

## Пасивний стан у різних часах

| Час | Active Voice | Passive Voice | Формула |
|-----|--------------|---------------|---------|
| **Present Simple** | They make cars here. | Cars **are made** here. | am/is/are + V3 |
| **Present Continuous** | They are making a film. | A film **is being made**. | am/is/are being + V3 |
| **Present Perfect** | They have finished the work. | The work **has been finished**. | have/has been + V3 |
| **Past Simple** | They built this house in 1990. | This house **was built** in 1990. | was/were + V3 |
| **Past Continuous** | They were repairing the road. | The road **was being repaired**. | was/were being + V3 |
| **Past Perfect** | They had cleaned the room. | The room **had been cleaned**. | had been + V3 |
| **Future Simple** | They will open a new store. | A new store **will be opened**. | will be + V3 |
| **Future Perfect** | They will have completed it. | It **will have been completed**. | will have been + V3 |
| **Modal Verbs** | They must sign the contract. | The contract **must be signed**. | modal + be + V3 |

## Коли використовувати пасивний стан?

### 1. Невідомий виконавець
Коли ми не знаємо, хто виконав дію:
- My bike **was stolen** last night. *(Мій велосипед вкрали минулої ночі)*
- The window **has been broken**. *(Вікно розбили)*

### 2. Неважливий виконавець
Коли важлива сама дія, а не виконавець:
- The bridge **was built** in 2005. *(Міст побудували у 2005)*
- Spanish **is spoken** in many countries. *(Іспанською розмовляють у багатьох країнах)*

### 3. Очевидний виконавець
Коли зрозуміло, хто виконав дію:
- The thief **was arrested** yesterday. *(Злодія заарештували вчора)* — Зрозуміло, що поліція
- The patient **was examined** by the doctor. *(Пацієнта оглянув лікар)*

### 4. Формальний стиль
У науковій, діловій, офіційній мові:
- The experiment **was conducted** carefully. *(Експеримент був проведений ретельно)*
- New measures **will be implemented** next year. *(Нові заходи будуть впроваджені наступного року)*

### 5. Увічливість
Коли хочемо уникнути прямого звинувачення:
- ❌ You didn't lock the door! *(Грубо)*
- ✅ The door wasn't locked. *(Увічливо)*

## Дієслова, які НЕ використовуються в пасиві

Деякі дієслова **не мають пасивної форми**, бо вони не передають дію на об'єкт:

### Intransitive verbs (Неперехідні дієслова)
Дієслова без прямого об'єкта:
- ❌ ~~It was happened yesterday.~~
- ✅ It happened yesterday.

**Приклади:** happen, occur, appear, seem, exist, sleep, die, arrive, come, go

### Stative verbs (Дієслова стану)
Дієслова, що описують стан, а не дію:
- ❌ ~~The house is had by him.~~
- ✅ He has the house.

**Приклади:** have (володіти), belong, resemble, suit, fit, lack

## Пасив з двома об'єктами

Деякі дієслова мають два об'єкти (прямий і непрямий). Можна зробити пасив з кожним:

### Give / Send / Show / Tell / Teach

**Active:** They gave **John** **a prize**.
- **Passive 1:** John was given a prize. *(Більш поширено)*
- **Passive 2:** A prize was given to John.

**Active:** She sent **me** **an email**.
- **Passive 1:** I was sent an email. ✅
- **Passive 2:** An email was sent to me. ✅

### Buy / Make / Cook / Bring

**Active:** She bought **me** **a present**.
- **Passive 1:** ❌ ~~I was bought a present.~~ *(Неприродно)*
- **Passive 2:** A present was bought for me. ✅

## Типові помилки

### ❌ Помилка 1: Забули BE
- ❌ The car stolen yesterday.
- ✅ The car **was** stolen yesterday.

### ❌ Помилка 2: Неправильна форма BE
- ❌ The documents **is** signed.
- ✅ The documents **are** signed.

### ❌ Помилка 3: Забули Past Participle (V3)
- ❌ The house was **build** in 1990.
- ✅ The house was **built** in 1990.

### ❌ Помилка 4: Пасив з неперехідними дієсловами
- ❌ The accident was happened last night.
- ✅ The accident happened last night.

### ❌ Помилка 5: BY з неживими об'єктами (краще WITH)
- ❌ The window was broken **by** a stone.
- ✅ The window was broken **with** a stone.
- ✅ The door was opened **with** a key.

**Правило:** BY — для виконавця дії, WITH — для інструмента.

### ❌ Помилка 6: Зайвий BY
- ❌ I was born **by** my mother in 1990.
- ✅ I was born in 1990.

## Особливі випадки

### 1. Passive with GET (розмовний стиль)
Замість BE можна використовувати GET (більш неформально):
- He **got fired** last week. *(Його звільнили минулого тижня)*
- We **got invited** to the party. *(Нас запросили на вечірку)*
- My car **got stolen**. *(Мою машину вкрали)*

**Примітка:** GET passive використовується в розмовній мові і часто підкреслює несподіваність або негативну ситуацію.

### 2. Passive Infinitive
**Формула:** to be + V3
- This work needs **to be done** today. *(Цю роботу потрібно зробити сьогодні)*
- The door should **to be locked**. *(Двері слід замкнути)*
- I want **to be informed** about changes. *(Я хочу бути поінформованим про зміни)*

### 3. Passive Gerund
**Формула:** being + V3
- I don't like **being told** what to do. *(Мені не подобається, коли мені кажуть, що робити)*
- She avoided **being seen**. *(Вона уникала, щоб її побачили)*
- He enjoys **being praised**. *(Йому подобається, коли його хвалять)*

### 4. Causative (Have/Get something done)
Коли ми не робимо щось самі, а хтось робить це для нас:

**HAVE + object + V3:**
- I **had my car repaired**. *(Мені відремонтували машину)*
- She **had her hair cut**. *(Їй підстригли волосся)*

**GET + object + V3:**
- I need to **get my phone fixed**. *(Мені потрібно відремонтувати телефон)*
- We should **get the house painted**. *(Нам слід пофарбувати будинок)*

## Корисні поради

### 📌 Порада 1: Активний стан — краще для розмовної мови
Пасив робить мову більш формальною. В розмовній мові краще використовувати активний стан:
- ❌ Formal: The decision was made by the manager.
- ✅ Natural: The manager made the decision.

### 📌 Порада 2: Уникайте надмірного використання пасиву
Занадто багато пасиву робить текст важким для читання:
- ❌ The ball was thrown by John and was caught by Mary.
- ✅ John threw the ball and Mary caught it.

### 📌 Порада 3: Пасив у новинах і науці
Пасивний стан дуже поширений у новинах, наукових статтях, інструкціях:
- The suspect **was arrested** this morning.
- The study **was conducted** over three years.
- The mixture should **be heated** to 100°C.

### 📌 Порада 4: BY vs WITH
- **BY** — хто/що виконало дію *(агент)*
  - The letter was written **by** my friend.
- **WITH** — інструмент, засіб
  - The letter was written **with** a pen.

### 📌 Порада 5: Запам'ятайте фразу
**"I was born in [year/place]"** — завжди без BY:
- ✅ I was born in 1990.
- ✅ I was born in Ukraine.
- ❌ ~~I was born by my mother.~~

## Підсумок

| Аспект | Ключові моменти |
|--------|-----------------|
| **Формула** | BE (в потрібному часі) + V3 + (by Agent) |
| **Використання** | Невідомий/неважливий/очевидний виконавець, формальний стиль |
| **BY або WITH** | BY — агент, WITH — інструмент |
| **Не використовується** | З неперехідними дієсловами (happen, exist, etc.) |
| **Розмовний варіант** | GET + V3 (get fired, got stolen) |
| **Causative** | HAVE/GET + object + V3 |

**Пам'ятайте:** Пасивний стан — це інструмент для зміни фокусу речення. Використовуйте його усвідомлено, коли це справді потрібно! 🎯
